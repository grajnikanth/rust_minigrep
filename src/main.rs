// Program to take a string and file name from command line and then
// do a search for the string in the file and print the results

// std::env::args function returns an iterator of the command line arguments
// collect() function on the iterator saves them in a vector

    // Rust typically can infer the type but when the collect() function is used
    // Rust is not able to infer the types of data in the collection. So here

    // stored in the vector
